MoarFilterExtensionConfigs

Changelog:

1.0.4.1
	- Fixed wrong link for version check.
	- Fixed a typo in folder name.
	- Added Changelog.txt
	
1.0.4
	- Added 0.35m size filter and corresponding icon.
	- Converted icons to DDS format.
	
1.0.3
	- Updated folder name to be more in line with normal naming schema. If you are installing this manually, be sure to delete the old folder!
	- Added version file so that AVC can check for updates.
	
1.0.2
	- Added a check to prevent filter from showing old Squad parts that are somehow still in the game.
		These parts were "replaced" by squad by changing the original part categories to "none". But FE does not differentiate without being told to do so in a config file.
	- Added a config to fix invalid categories on a few Squad parts. Now they will show up in the proper sub-category for their size.

1.0
	- Initial release.
